# ðŸš€ Llama-2-7B Implementation  

This repository provides an implementation of the Llama-2-7B model for various Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It includes model setup, inference, and instruction tuning to generate meaningful responses. 

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Uses **Meta's Llama-2-7B** model for text generation.  
- Implements **quantization** to optimize memory usage (4-bit & 8-bit).  
- Demonstrates instruction tuning for fine-tuning responses.
- Supports **multi-GPU inference** using `accelerate`.  
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation.
